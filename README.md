# Hangman-Project

This is the first project for my AiCore data science course.

### About the game
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### Milestone_1

The code in this milestone:
- defines the list of possible words for the game 
- randomly selects a word from the list
- prompts the user to enter a letter 
- checks that the input is a single letter

Uses Python3, importing random for word selection.

### Milestone_2
In this milestone, I have defined the functions ask_for_input and check_guess.
ask_for_input asks the user to guess a letter and checks that the input is valid.
check_guess converts the input to lowercase, then checks to see if the letter is in the secret word.
